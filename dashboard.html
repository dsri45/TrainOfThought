                    <div class="framework-description">
                        Utilitarian ethics, also known as consequentialism, is a moral framework that evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes. The core principle is to maximize overall happiness, well-being, or utility for the greatest number of people. A utilitarian-driven person makes decisions by calculating the net benefit or harm that will result from their actions, prioritizing the option that produces the best overall consequences.

                            <li><strong>Outcome-focused:</strong> Decisions are evaluated based on the results they produce, not the actions themselves</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantitative thinking:</strong> Tends to weigh costs and benefits, often thinking in terms of numbers or scales of impact</li>
                            <li><strong>Impartial perspective:</strong> Strives to treat all individuals equally when calculating overall utility</li>
                            <li><strong>Pragmatic approach:</strong> Willing to make difficult choices if they lead to better overall outcomes</li>
                            <li><strong>Future-oriented:</strong> Considers long-term consequences and ripple effects of decisions</li>
                            <li><strong>Flexible principles:</strong> May break traditional rules if doing so produces better results</li>

                        <p>In the classic trolley problem, a utilitarian would likely pull the lever to divert the train, sacrificing one person to save five. The calculation is straightforward: five lives saved outweighs one life lost, resulting in a net positive outcome. A utilitarian might also support policies like vaccination mandates or resource allocation during emergencies, where the greater good takes precedence over individual preferences.</p>

                    <div class="framework-description">
                        Deontological ethics, derived from the Greek word "deon" meaning duty, is a rule-based moral framework that judges the morality of actions based on adherence to moral rules, duties, and principles. A deontological person believes that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. They follow moral rules because it's the right thing to do, not because it leads to better outcomes.

                            <li><strong>Action-focused:</strong> The morality of an action is determined by the action itself, not its consequences</li>
                            <li><strong>Consistent principles:</strong> Applies the same moral rules across all situations</li>
                            <li><strong>Rights-oriented:</strong> Emphasizes individual rights and the duty to respect them</li>
                            <li><strong>Impartial application:</strong> Believes moral rules should apply equally to everyone</li>
                            <li><strong>Resistant to compromise:</strong> Less willing to bend rules even when outcomes might be better</li>

                    <div class="framework-example">
                        <h4>Example in Practice:</h4>
                        <p>In the trolley problem, a deontological person might refuse to pull the lever, arguing that actively causing someone's death (even to save others) violates the moral rule against killing. They might say "I cannot be responsible for killing someone, even if it means others die." This person would also oppose lying, stealing, or breaking promises, even if doing so could prevent greater harm, because these actions violate fundamental moral duties.</p>

This framework emphasizes the importance of relationships and emotional responses in moral reasoning.
