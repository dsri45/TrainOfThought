            <h2>What is the Trolley Problem?</h2>
            <p>The trolley problem is a famous thought experiment in ethics and philosophy. Imagine a runaway trolley is barreling down a railway track. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them.</p>
            <p>You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:</p>
            <p><strong>Do nothing</strong> and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track, or <strong>pull the lever</strong>, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</p>
            <p>What would you do?</p>
